# CO₂ Emissions Forecasting (SDG 13: Climate Action)

## Objective
Forecast CO₂ emissions using supervised machine learning models based on economic and energy indicators.

## Dataset
Sources: World Bank, Kaggle (CO₂ emissions by country)

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ML Approach
- Supervised Learning: Random Forest Regression

## Ethical Reflection
Bias may arise from data availability gaps between countries. This project supports fair climate policies through data-driven insights.
