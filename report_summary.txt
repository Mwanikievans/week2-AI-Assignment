CO₂ Emissions Forecasting for Climate Action (SDG 13)

Problem:
Identify and predict CO₂ emission trends using economic and energy indicators to support sustainable policies.

ML Approach:
Supervised learning using Random Forest Regression.

Results:
Model achieved R² = 0.82. It identifies top CO₂ emitters and highlights at-risk regions based on economic indicators.

Ethical Consideration:
Data disparities across countries can bias predictions. Ensuring fairness in global climate policy is essential.
